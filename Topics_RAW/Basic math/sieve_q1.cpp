n = 6
Input list: 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15
After processing the input list, hash[] looks like this (non-zero entries):
less
Copy code
hash[2] = 1  // The number 2 appears once.
hash[3] = 1  // The number 3 appears once.
hash[6] = 1  // The number 6 appears once.
hash[9] = 1  // The number 9 appears once.
hash[12] = 1 // The number 12 appears once.
hash[15] = 1 // The number 15 appears once.

i = 2: Now, count multiples of 2.

j = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, ...
We add the count of each multiple from hash[]:
css
Copy code
multiple_ct[2] += hash[2]  -> multiple_ct[2] = 1  (from hash[2] = 1)
multiple_ct[2] += hash[4]  (but hash[4] = 0)
multiple_ct[2] += hash[6]  -> multiple_ct[2] = 2  (from hash[6] = 1)
multiple_ct[2] += hash[12] -> multiple_ct[2] = 3  (from hash[12] = 1)
So, after processing i = 2, multiple_ct[2] = 3. 
This means there are 3 numbers divisible by 2 (which are 2, 6, and 12).
